## Software Development Methods

### Waterfall (build it twice)

### Spiral (no massive upfront analysis)
![alt text](https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/software-development-methodologies-net-solutions-spiral-model.jpg)

requirements have to be known before development phase, this isnt very realistic, so SCRUM has been adopted.

# Agile **core values**
* **individuals** and **interactions** over processes and tools
* **working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **responding to change** over following a plan

### Twelve Agile Principals

# Scrum
## values
- Openness
- Focus
- Respect
- Courage
- Commitment
## roles
- **Product ower** (PO) a.k.a customer voice
    - translates user requirements into **user stories**
    - maintains and priotitises the **backlog**
    - negotiates content of **releases** and **timing** with the team
- **Scrum Master** (SM) a.k.a process leader and facilitator
    - acts as a **coach** i.e does not commands
    - facilitates **communication indide** and **outside** the team
    - represents management, but **protects** team members
- **Team** a.k.a developers
    - everyone is a **developer** (often even the SM) no heiracy
    - **self-organising** and **cross-functional** (low bus factor)
    - **collective responsibility** for acheivements (snow ploughing)

## product vision and sprint goal
all starts with a **vision**
- creates **initial backlog** with **user stories** and **acceptance criteria**
- requires some **grooming** (continuously=Kanban, before a sprint=Scrum)
- **priorities** are defined by sorting the backlog, by the **PO**

Scrum and Kanban have different bootstrap modes
| Scrum | Kanban 
|:------|:-------
larger initial effor is needed before the development starts | task-oriented, starts as soon as there is 'enough' work

Each Scrum sprint has its own **goal**
- each new product **increment** must be **coherent**
- the product owner proposes, the team discusses

## Sprint Planning
### Part 1 - what is the value of this sprint?
the team collabs to define the goal, with input from the PO.
- a sprint should be as **choerent** as possible (i.e spring goal)

### Part 2 - what is the new increment?
- the team discusses what can be done with the PO
- the team estimates the **complexity** of each story

use previous sprints as a reference (i.e **velocity**) to inform plan

### Part 3 - how will the new increment be implemented?
- selected stories are **broken down into tasks** by the team
- tasks are described **thoroughly** i.e everyone can pick it up
developers are not **assigning** tasks
 
### Planning Poker
- Fib squenece reflects a progressing uncertainty
- from 1-inf AND a **coffee** card

### Frequent Synchronisation Points
Three simple quesions of stand-ups called **Daily Scrum** 
- what did you **acheive yesturday**
- what will you **do today**
- are you **facing and issues** or impediments

daily **Scrum** meetings
- should last **3 mins per member AT MOST**
- look at the **preogress** towards the **sprint goal**
- is the place to identify **roadblocks** and seek help or take action
- is **no place** for **finger pointing** or long tech discussions
